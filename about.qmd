These are a series of small shiny apps I developed for teaching.
Please feel free to use them in your courses or for your personal learning.

As learning from my R code is part of the learning, the source for these pages can be found on my github account:  [github:ralmond/TeachingDemos](https://github.com/ralmond/TeachingDemos).

If you see a problem feel free to raise an issue on github (or better yet, send me a pull request with a fix for the issue.)
