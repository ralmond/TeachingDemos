These are a series of small shiny apps I developed for teaching.
Please feel free to use them in your courses or for your personal learning.

As learning from my R code is part of the learning, the source for these pages can be found on my github account:  [github:ralmond/TeachingDemos](https://github.com/ralmond/TeachingDemos).

The following sets of demos are available.

* [Intro Stats](IntroStats/index.qmd) -- Demos for an introductory statistics class, includes an online normal distribution calculator.

<!--
* [Bayesian Stats](Bayesian/index.qmd) -- Some Bayesian demonstrations including Beta-Binomial and Normal-Normal shiny apps and some sample stan code.
-->

* [R Intro](RIntro/index.qmd) -- Some various talks I've given on how to use R (no narration).
